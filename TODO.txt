Just a text file with some personal todo goals

High priority:
1. Create test framework for new users

2. Add the rasp pi specific pipeline

3. Add a subset of pi data for Emiel to play around with (needs script to generate)

4. Fix the points disappearing bug

5. Add normalisation to xeno canto data before emedding (probably also before clips)

Medium priority:
1. Optimize scripts to accept more custom directory structure from config files.
mostly talking about cd at the start, should accept a root from config files.
And should also check wether conflicts arise upon changing existing directory
from config files (talking about what is now z slim)

2. Add lines to UMAP and EUMAP to show which data correspond to listed audio-
files in the playlist widget. Also add last 4 digits form xc_ID and the clip index

3. Fix the structure of the github so that xc_pipeline is a subfolder

low priority:

Implement lasso select tool from bokeh documentation
Implement freedraw
implement alpha spinner
