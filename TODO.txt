Just a text file with some personal todo goals

High priority:

- Add the rasp pi specific pipeline

- Add a subset of pi data for Emiel to play around with (needs script to generate)

- Fix the points disappearing bug

- Add normalisation to xeno canto data before emedding (probably also before clips)

Medium priority:
- Optimize scripts to accept more custom directory structure from config files.
mostly talking about cd at the start, should accept a root from config files.
And should also check wether conflicts arise upon changing existing directory
from config files (talking about what is now z slim)

- Add lines to UMAP and EUMAP to show which data correspond to listed audio-
files in the playlist widget. Also add last 4 digits form xc_ID and the clip index

- Fix the structure of the github so that xc_pipeline is a subfolder

low priority:

-Implement lasso select tool from bokeh documentation
-Implement freedraw
-implement alpha spinner
-implement size spinner

-update stats display more accurately
